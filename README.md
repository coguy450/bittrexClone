this project uses the bittrex and coinbase apis to place buy and sell orders.
There is a crypto screener which helps you select which coins to buy, you can
then buy the coin at whatever price you enter. If you click on closed orders, this
will automatically add the holdings which you've bought and sold lately. From closedOrders
orders you can enter the amount of profit you want to make from that coin before auto selling.
